Project name: Parkit
Participants: Ariel Abramovitz, Daya Matok Gawi, Matanya Wiener, Noy Porat and Natalie Kern-Iacob

Our motivation for creating this website was to give a solution to the parking problem that each and every one of us has faced at least once in our lives.
We implemented a website for facilitating an online marketplace for renting out private parking spaces using React, CSS, HTML, Javascript.

Our homepage looks like that, You can choose if you want to rent to someone or from someone:

If you want to rent to someone, You click on the left button and you get this window, you should fill the form below:

Now, your details are saved into our database.

If you want to rent from someone, you press the right button and fill the form like that:

Then you press submit and you should get this map:**

You can choose the address for the area of the wanted parking and the available parkings will appeared.

If our database is empty, you will get this message:

**
Right now, the map and the database aren't connected, so our future goal is to connect them.

We learned React from scratch and we used WebStorm for the first time. It was challenging and fun.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
